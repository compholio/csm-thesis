% \section{About This Guide}
%
% The Colorado School of Mines Office of Graduate Studies (OGS) publishes this guide for graduate students in all departments who must prepare a master's thesis or doctor of philosophy dissertation as part of the requirements for a CSM graduate degree. In this guide, the word ``thesis'' refers to both the thesis and the dissertation, unless otherwise noted.
% 
% Every CSM thesis is deposited with the Arthur Lakes Library as part of its permanent collection and for long-term preservation. To produce a final manuscript of high quality, consistent adherence to the University's standards of organization and formatting is crucial. This guide is meant as a set of minimum guidelines for producing the final copies of your thesis.
% 
% Before submission to the Library, each completed thesis must receive final format approval from OGS. If you follow the formatting guidelines defined in this document, your thesis format will be accepted.
% 
% Some variations in thesis format may be accepted for the main body and references; however, every thesis must include the required parts of the front matter. In addition, every thesis must follow the conventions for page numbering and margins described in this document.
% 
% If you choose an alternative format, OGS retains the right to accept or reject this formatting at its discretion. Therefore, prior to submitting your thesis to the OGS for final format review, it is in your best interest to verify with the OGS staff that your format is acceptable. You will find examples of recommended and required page formats for various parts of the thesis in \ref{apx:examples}.
% 
% Unless stated differently, required forms referred to in this guide may be found online at the OGS website under Graduate School Forms,\newline
% \url{http://gradschool.mines.edu/GS-Forms}.
% 
% Included in \ref{apx:checklists} of this guide are procedure check lists for 1) writing and defending your thesis; 2) submitting required forms; 3) formatting your thesis, and 4) printing and submitting your thesis.
%
% \section{Helpful Resources}
% 
% Although this guide contains some writing tips, it is not a handbook for technical writing. Students who want to learn more about technical writing style, punctuation, and grammar may find information on campus at the LAIS Writing Center,\newline
% \url{http://writing.mines.edu/}.
%
% The LAIS Writing Center is a free tutorial service available to all CSM students. Tutors in the Writing Center work \emph{with} students to improve their writing; however, the Center is not a proofreading and editing service.
% 
% There are numerous manuals available to help students who are writing a thesis. Before purchasing a text or downloading information, you should consult with the OGS and/or your faculty advisor for suggestions of the best reference tools specific to your discipline. A partial list of such style manuals appears in \ref{apx:resources}.
%
% \section{Before Writing Your Thesis}
% 
% You should begin your thesis process by the second semester of classes as a master's student or at least one year before you plan to receive your degree, as a Ph.D. student. Below are some items to consider as you begin the thesis process.
% 
% \subsection{Review OGS requirements}
% 
% As a thesis writer, you are encouraged to communicate with the OGS staff to verify that you are following the necessary guidelines for producing the thesis. You should also be certain that you understand the process of registering for research credits.
% 
% \subsection{Review department requirements}
% 
% CSM academic departments may have additional requirements specific to their discipline. It is your responsibility to know the deadlines specific to your department and whether or not special organization and formatting are required. If special department or committee requirements contradict the information in this guide, you must resolve the conflict before writing the thesis.
% 
% \subsection{Request thesis advisor and committee}
% 
% At both the master's and Ph.D. levels, the student is responsible for choosing a thesis advisor. The Dean of Graduate Studies appoints the thesis committee, based on the recommendations of the student, thesis advisor, and department head. A signed Advisor/Thesis Committee form must be filed with the OGS.
% 
% \subsection{Present research proposal}
% 
% After a thesis topic has been selected, a research proposal is written. The research proposal is a description of the research the student intends to undertake, which will be reported in a more detailed and comprehensive fashion in the thesis. The proposal is your opportunity to convince the advisory committee of your ability to pursue the project to a successful conclusion. After the thesis proposal has been formally approved by the committee, the Admission to Candidacy form is submitted to OGS. The thesis proposal itself does not need to be approved by the OGS.
% 
% \section{Writing Your Thesis}
% 
% The work described in a CSM thesis must be conducted under the supervision of a candidate's advisory committee, and the thesis must state in detail all results obtained and all methods and processes used in the research. Descriptions of method must be made in such a way that they may be duplicated by any competent researcher. Below are some other points to consider.
% 
% \subsection{Including proprietary research}
% 
% Under special circumstances, CSM may agree to include proprietary research in a graduate student's thesis. The nature and extent of the proprietary research reported in the thesis must be agreed upon in writing by the principal investigator, student, and Dean of Graduate Studies (Proprietary Research Agreement form). In some cases, the proprietary nature of the underlying research may require the school to delay public access to the completed thesis for a limited period of time. In no case will public access to the thesis be denied for more than 12 months from the date the Statement of Work Completion form is submitted to the OGS.
% 
% \subsection{Following required guidelines}
% 
% As you write your thesis, consult with your advisor and committee as necessary. Edit all drafts for correct sentence structure and grammar, paragraphing, punctuation and spelling. Specific OGS requirements for thesis organization, style and formatting are found in this guidebook.
% 
% \subsection{Registering for copyright}
% 
% Students own the copyright to their thesis and you may wish to register your work with the Library of Congress. Typically, the holder of the copyright is required to submit two copies of the copyrighted work, a registration fee, and a completed application form (Form TX). To order forms, call the Copyright Office Form Hotline at 202-707-9100. Additional information is found at the Copyright Office website:\newline
% \url{http://www.copyright.gov/}.
% 
% \subsection{Obtaining publisher permissions}
% 
% If you wish to include material in your thesis that has been previously published, permission from the publisher may be required. In addition, academic department policies vary regarding the inclusion of such material, and therefore the approval of your advisory committee is required.
% 
% \section{Completing Your Thesis}
% 
% Once you have finished writing your thesis, there are required steps to perform before the process is complete and your degree is awarded. Those steps are described below and are summarized in a checklist in \ref{apx:checklists}.
% 
% \subsection{Application to Graduate}
% 
% Within five weeks of the beginning of the semester in which you expect to graduate, submit an Application to Graduate form to OGS.
% 
% \subsection{Schedule the thesis defense}
% 
% The student must orally defend the written thesis in front of the advisor and advisory committee before the thesis submittal deadline that is set by the OGS each semester. Upon finishing the writing of your thesis, schedule the thesis defense, allowing enough time (roughly two weeks) for committee members to thoroughly examine the thesis. Keep in mind that several students may be arranging defenses for essentially the same time, with the same faculty members. You should also be aware of your department's deadlines for defending.
% 
% \note{The thesis defense is open to the public.}
% 
% \subsection{Submit Thesis Defense Request form}
% 
% At least one week before the thesis defense, submit the Thesis Defense Request form to your home department.
% 
% \subsection{Defend and revise the thesis}
% 
% Your committee may require you to make additional revisions following your thesis defense. Be certain that you allow enough time between your defense date and the thesis submittal deadline to complete these revisions.
% 
% \note{Your department may have a maximum time allowed for the completion of revisions following the thesis defense; you should become aware of any such requirement.}
% 
% \subsection{Obtain required signatures}
% 
% Once your advisor and advisory committee have approved the defended and revised thesis, you must sign and date the submittal sheet (ii). Your thesis advisor (and coadvisor, if applicable) and department head must also sign and date the submittal sheet. Black ink is preferred for signatures.
% 
% \note{You must obtain all signatures prior to submitting the thesis to the OGS for final format evaluation.}
% 
% \subsection{Obtain final format approval}
% 
% \important{After your department head and advisor have approved the defended and revised thesis and have signed the submittal sheet, submit the final draft to the OGS for format evaluation.}
% 
% The format evaluation is a general review of the document to check for consistency, proper chapter sequence, correct font and margins, and proper table and figure placement. To receive approval, the draft you submit for evaluation by OGS must exactly duplicate the final submission you will present to the library for preservation, including any labeled and folded plates, maps, and CD/DVDs.
% 
% \note{The OGS reviewer does not edit the thesis during format evaluation. You should plan to leave your thesis with the OGS for 24 hours.}
% 
% \subsection{Print required copies}
% 
% You are responsible for printing the final copies of the thesis that are submitted to the Arthur Lakes Library for binding and preservation. Details on printing requirements are found in the section \hyperref[sec:printing-thesis]{Printing Your Thesis}, page~\pageref{sec:printing-thesis}.
% 
% \subsection{Obtain virus scan for CD/DVDs}
% 
% To submit any part of your thesis on CD/DVD, you must first have your disk certified by the AC\&N department as virus free. To learn more about this requirement, see \hyperref[sec:computer-disks]{Computer disks}, page~\pageref{sec:computer-disks}.
% 
% \subsection{Pay fees}
% 
% You must pay graduation and all other outstanding fees to the CSM cashier before submitting your thesis copies to the library for binding.
% 
% \subsection{Submit copies to Arthur Lakes Library}
% 
% The award of a thesis-based graduate degree is conditioned on the student's submittal of the completed thesis to the campus library, ensuring its availability to the public. Although the student retains the copyright of the thesis, by depositing the thesis with the library, the student assigns a perpetual, nonexclusive, royalty-free license to CSM and permits CSM to copy the thesis and allow the public reasonable access to it. Detailed information on how to submit your thesis to Arthur Lakes Library is found on page~\pageref{sec:submitting-your-thesis}.
% 
% \subsection{Check Out}
% 
% You can obtain the required checkout card either at the OGS, Guggenheim Hall, or at the Graduation Salute, which is held each semester. Part of the checkout procedure is also the submission of the Statement of Work Completion form that may be found online at \url{http://gradschool.mines.edu/GS-Forms}. For your convenience, you will also find Graduation Information and Deadlines in this same location.

% \section{Organizing Your Thesis}
% 
% A thesis has three main parts: 1) front matter, 2) body, and 3) back matter. The elements of each main part listed here are further explained in separate sections, but they should appear in the sequence shown here.
% 
% \subsection{Parts of a Thesis}
% 
% \subsubsection{Front Matter (preliminary pages)}
% \begin{enumerate}
% 	\item Title page\dotfill (required)
% 	\item Copyright page\dotfill (if applicable)
% 	\item Submittal sheet or signature page\dotfill (required)
% 	\item Abstract\index{abstract}\dotfill (required)
% 	\item Table of Contents\dotfill (required)
% 	\item List of Figures\dotfill (if applicable)
% 	\item List of Tables\dotfill (if applicable)
% 	\item List of Plates\dotfill (if applicable)
% 	\item Acknowledgments\index{acknowledgments}\dotfill (optional)
% 	\item Dedication\dotfill (optional)
% \end{enumerate}
% 
% \subsubsection{Body}
% \begin{enumerate}
% 	\item Introduction\dotfill (optional)
% 	\item All chapters and sections of text\dotfill (required)
% \end{enumerate}
% 
% \subsubsection{Back Matter (supplementaries)}
% \begin{enumerate}
% 	\item References Cited\dotfill (required)
% 	\item Selected Bibliography\dotfill (optional)
% 	\item Appendices\index{appendices}\dotfill (if applicable)
% \end{enumerate}
% 
% A thesis might also include a \textbf{glossary}, a \textbf{list of symbols}, or a \textbf{list of \addtoindex{abbreviations}}. Any of these lists may either follow the last list in the front matter or precede the References Cited section in the back matter.
% 
% \subsection{Alternative Organization}
% 
% In addition to the thesis organization described above, there may be cases where an alternative organization is appropriate.
% 
% \subsubsection{Multi-part thesis}
% 
% With the approval of the faculty advisor, a student may combine research in related areas into a single thesis that includes published or unpublished papers and/or multiple projects. In a multi-part thesis, the research is arranged in a coherent order with consecutive page numbering throughout the body and back matter. A multi-part thesis has a single table of contents and other front matter as well as a single list of references and other back matter.
% 
% Please be aware that a multi-part thesis containing previously published material may be subject to copyright permission issues. Copyright policies are discussed on page~\pageref{sec:using-copyrighted-material}, \hyperref[sec:using-copyrighted-material]{Using Copyrighted Material}.
% 
% \section{Formatting Your Thesis}
% 
% \important{Producing text that is visually and stylistically \emph{consistent}, gives a professional look and feel to your thesis. Though some thesis format elements are strictly required by the OGS, many formatting decisions are left to your discretion. However, once you have made those choices, you must apply them throughout the entire thesis. OGS requirements are marked with the light bulb symbol for quick identification.}
% 
% \subsection{Using format templates}
% 
% Microsoft and {\LaTeX} both offer software for formatting a thesis. {\LaTeX} may be downloaded from\newline \url{http://www.Latex-project.org/}.
% 
% Software packages are also available for formatting references. One such application is EndNote.
% 
% \note{CSM does not provide technical support for these templates.}
% 
% \paragraph{Using student models}
% 
% You should be cautious if you use a previous student's thesis as a model for your own. OGS changed certain format requirements beginning with the Spring 2007 Fifth Edition of this guidebook, and what was previously acceptable may no longer be so.
% 
% \subsection{Thesis Length}
% 
% There is no upper page limit for a thesis; however, a bound volume is limited to the thickness of two inches, including folded maps, plates and CDs.
% 
% \subsubsection{Single-volume thesis}
% 
% In order to stay within the two-inch limit for a single volume, we suggest the following practices:
% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item Write as concisely as possible.
% 	\item Use 1{\textonehalf} line spacing rather than 2 in running text.
% 	\item Print the thesis on two sides of the paper, instead of printing single sided.
%% 		\important{\textbf{Exceptions:} The pages of the front matter must be printed single sided. The first page of each new chapter in the thesis body must begin on an oddnumbered (right-handed) page, leaving the opposing page blank if necessary.}
%\iffalse
%% The built-in \cleardoublepage prints a page number, this special version does not
% \renewcommand{\cleardoublepage}{
% 	\@ifstar{\null}{}
% 	\clearpage %% Dump all floats before making our new page
% 	\newpage
% 	\thispagestyle{empty} %% There is no page number for blank pages
% 	%% If we are doing a two-sided document then the next page MUST be an odd-numbered page
% 	\if@twoside
% 		\ifodd\c@truepage \else
% 			%% Use \hbox{} instead of \null?
% 			\null\newpage
% 			\if@twocolumn
% 				\null\newpage
% 			\fi
% 		\fi
% 	\fi
% 	\thispagestyle{plain} %% Go back to page numbers for normal pages
% }
\newcommand{\newoddpage}{\cleardoublepage}

%\fi
% 	\item Store large appendices as well as maps, plates, figures, tables, and other over-sized material on CD/DVD. This option is further described on page \pageref{sec:computer-disks}, \hyperref[sec:computer-disks]{Computer disks}.
% \end{itemize}
% 
% \subsubsection{Multi-volume thesis}
% \label{sec:multi-volume-thesis}
% 
% A thesis thicker than two inches (including any supplementary elements such as folded plates or CD's), must be bound in more than one volume, and the writer must pay an additional binding fee for each volume. Each volume of the multi-volume thesis must have a title page that includes the volume number and a table of contents. You are encouraged to obtain advice from the Arthur Lakes Library Preservation Unit or the OGS about where to split thesis material into two volumes.
% 
% \subsection{Page Margins}
% 
%% The required thesis page size is 8{\textonehalf} by 11 inches (letter size). The page margins given here are required and not optional.
%% \begin{itemize}
%% 	\item Top and bottom text margins: 1 inch wide.
%% 	\item Inside text margin (binding side): 1{\textonehalf} inch wide.
%% 	\item Outside text margin: no less than 1 inch wide.
%% 	\item Two-sided printing: the inside and outside margin widths should alternate pages. (Most word processing programs will automatically alternate margins on odd and even pages for documents that are copied on two sides).
%% 	\item Page-number margin: {\textonehalf} inch from either the top or the bottom edge of the page.
%% \end{itemize}
%\iffalse
\RequirePackage[left=1in,top=1in,right=1in,bottom=1in,bindingoffset=0.0in,nohead,foot=0.5in]{geometry}

%\fi
% 
% \note{Photocopying may enlarge an image, in which case, you should be certain that your margin widths stay within these requirements. For the same reason, when printing an electronic file or converting a file to PDF format, be certain to turn off the Scale to Page feature.}
% 
% \subsection{Aligning Text}\index{alignment}
% 
%% OGS prefers left-margin justification of paragraph text with ``ragged right'' edges. Right margin justification is accepted \emph{only} if the word spacing is proportional, with no extra white space between words.
%\iffalse
%% <<NOTE: LaTeX has no ragged edges, on either side, by default>>

%\fi
% 
% \subsection{Centering Text}
% 
%% When this guide directs that text and graphics be centered on the page between the left and right text margins, please note that is not the same as centering between the left and right edges of the paper. Keep in mind that the left and right margins on a page are not equal in width.
%\iffalse
%% <<NOTE: There is no easy way to make this mistake in LaTeX, it knows how to center properly>>

%\fi
% 
% \subsection{Page Numbers}
% 
% \important{Requirements for the font style and location of page numbers in the thesis front matter differ from requirements for page numbers in the body and back matter of the thesis.}
% 
% \subsubsection{Front matter page numbers}
% 
%% Roman numerals are used for page numbering of the front matter. Page numbers on the title page and copyright page are not displayed. Displayed page numbering begins on the submittal sheet, and is always roman numeral two (ii), regardless of whether or not a copyright page is included. The first page of the \addtoindex{abstract} is roman numeral three (iii), and so forth for the rest of the front matter.
%% 
%% Page numbers in the front matter are placed centered between the left and right text margins and {\textonehalf} inch from the bottom edge of the paper.

}

%\fi
% 
% \subsubsection{Main body and back matter page numbers}
% 
%% Arabic numerals are used for the page numbering of the main body and of the back matter. The page number on the first page of the body (Introduction or Chapter 1) is arabic numeral one (1). The arabic numbering continues consecutively throughout the rest of the thesis, including the back matter.
%% 
%% Page numbers in the body and back matter are placed at any appropriate place on the page. However, the placement of the page numbers must remain consistent throughout the body and back matter. Page numbers are usually placed at the top right text margin, {\textonehalf} inch from the top edge of the page.

% 
% As an alternative, you may include a longer \addtoindex{abstract} in the thesis and also separately submit a shorter summary to OGS that adheres to the 350-word limit. The submission of the shorter summary is part of the graduation checkout requirement.

% 
% \subsection{Dedication}
% 
% A dedication page is optional and not frequently included in a thesis. However, occasionally the thesis writer wants to dedicate the document to a professional colleague, friend or relative. A dedication typically expresses gratitude for someone's support.
% 
% \subsubsection{Dedication format}
% 
% If a dedication page is included, it is placed at the end of the front matter section, following the acknowledgments. Typically, a dedication page has no title; it simply states, e.g., ``For my father.'' Roman numeral page numbering continues on the dedication page, which is blank on the back side.
% 
% \section{About the Main Body}
% 
% The body of the thesis is the main text. It may begin with an introduction or immediately with chapter one, and it may have several numbered chapters or unnumbered sections, depending on the preference of the department or advisor.
% 
% \subsection{Titles}
% 
% The chapter or section title for each part of the body is typed only on the first page of that part in all capital letters (for example, INTRODUCTION) and not underlined. The title is centered between the left and right text margins, one keyboard return below the one-inch top page margin.
% 
% \subsection{Headings and Subheadings}
% 
% Within each titled chapter of the thesis body, section headings are used to help the reader understand the organization of the information.
% 
% \important{At least one paragraph of text must follow each heading or subheading. Headings and subheadings may not follow each other without some text between, and may not stand alone at the bottom of a page. If after the heading or subheading, there is not room for at least two lines of 1{\textonehalf}- or doublespaced text before the bottom text margin, then the heading is placed at the top of the next page.}
% 
% You must follow your department's preference for the heading system and style, but two frequently used systems are the doublenumbering system or the three-level system.
% 
% \subsubsection{Double-numbering system}
% 
%% In the double-numbering system, each heading is preceded by a number. For instance, in the second chapter of a thesis, the first subheading is numbered 2.1. The use of heading numbers requires at least two subdivisions under each main division. That is, if there is a 2.1, there must be a 2.2. If there is only one division under a heading, then that division is labeled as 2.0, not 2.1. An example page illustrating the numbering system is included in \ref{apx:examples}.
% 
%% Numbered headings and subheadings use capital and lower case letters and are all placed flush with the left margin. Three single lines precede a heading or subheading, and one keyboard return follows it.

% \subsubsection{Three-level system}
% 
% The three-level system uses the following heading levels.
% 
% \textbf{A-Level:} This heading uses both capital and lower case bold letters, and is left justified. Three single lines separate the heading from preceding text, and one keyboard return separates the heading from the following text.
% 
% \textbf{B-Level:} This heading uses both capital and lower case bold letters, and is indented from the left text margin. Long subheadings are broken into two lines and single spaced, with the second line indented from the first line. Three single lines separate the subheading from preceding text, and one keyboard return follows the subheading before the text that follows.
% 
% \textbf{C-Level:} This heading uses both capital and lower case bold letters and is indented from the left text margin incrementally from the B-Level heading. Three single lines separate the subheading from preceding text, but the text of the subsection begins on the same line as the subheading.

% \subsection{Writing Numbers in Text}
% 
% In scientific writing, it is customary to write out numbers one through nine in the text. It is also customary to use arabic numerals for numbers 10 and above, except when the number appears at the beginning of a sentence. Numbers appearing at the beginning of a sentence should always be written out. Other notable exceptions: arabic numerals are always used with percent, units or actual measurements, time (when used with a.m. and p.m.), fractional numbers, and data taken directly from a table or figure.

% Quotations shorter than three typed lines are included in the running text and are preceded and followed by quotation marks. The source must be documented at the end of the quote. (See \hyperref[sec:referencing-sources]{Referencing Sources in Text}, page~\pageref{sec:referencing-sources}.)
% 
% \subsubsection{Long quotations}
% 
% Quotations longer than three lines of text (block quotations) are single-spaced, indented from both the left and right text margins, and separated from the text above and below by one keyboard return. Block quotations do not require quotation marks.
% 
% \subsubsection{Abbreviating quoted passages}
% 
% It is acceptable to omit irrelevant information from a direct quote. In that case a number of ellipsis points (. . .) are used to show where information has been omitted. You should check a writing manual for further details on the correct use of ellipsis points.
% 
% \subsection{Including Figures and Tables}
% 
% A figure is a graphic illustration of information, such as a line drawing, a graph, a map, a photograph, a plate, or a chart. A table is a graphic that contains a systematic arrangement of facts or numbers in rows and columns (that is, in tabular form). A table appearing in running text should show only information relevant to that text.
% 
% \subsubsection{Placing a figure or table}
% 
%% A figure or table that covers more than a half page may be placed on its own, separate page. More than one table or figure may appear in sequence on a single page, if they represent sequential information. A figure or table included in running text must be contained on a single page and not continued to the next page. Use consistent line spacing to separate the figure or table from the preceding and following text.
% 
%\iffalse
%% The test below checks to see if the user has requested ``Here Definitely'', we then check after the float to see if it was pushed to the next page.  If that happens then the document will have too much space at the bottom of a page (and will therefore be incompliant with the OGS guidelines).

% 
% Small, two- or three-column tables with only three or four items per column may be worked into the text without an identifying table number or caption.
% 
% \subsubsection{Oversized figure or table}
% 
% If a table must cover more than one page, headings for continuous columns are repeated on each page, and notes may appear either at the end of the table or on the page to which they refer. Sources appear at the bottom of the first page.
% 
% Figures and tables that are formatted wider than they are high may be turned to fit on the page within all margins. The entire illustration, including its caption and sources, is turned so that the top of the illustration is parallel to and just inside the regular binding-side text margin (landscape orientation). The page number, however, remains in the same position on the page (portrait orientation), as it is throughout the body and back matter of the document.
% 
% A figure or table too large to fit within the 6- inch by 9-inch text area may be reduced, but its caption font must be the same size and style as that used for the text in the rest of the thesis.

% \subsubsection{Numbering a figure or table}
% 
% Figures and tables are numbered consecutively throughout the text of the thesis. If numbered headings are used in the text, then a parallel numbering system is used for illustrations. For instance, the first figure in Chapter 2 would be Figure 2.1 and the following figure would be Figure 2.2, etc. Related figures may be identified either by using the same number with a lower case letter (Figure 4.3a, Figure 4.3b), or by different numbers (Figure 4.3, Figure 4.4).

%\makeatother
% 
% \subsection{Including Photographs}
% 
% \important{Illustrative photographs included in the text of a thesis, should be scanned to a digital format and as either black and white or color. Color photographs should be printed in color. Do not glue actual photos onto a page. A photograph used as a figure is given a number and caption.}
% 
% \subsection{Including Maps and Plates}
% 
% \important{You are encouraged to include larger maps and plates on CD or DVD. (For labeling requirements, see \hyperref[sec:thesis-pocket-contents]{Thesis Pocket Contents}, page~\pageref{sec:thesis-pocket-contents}.)}
% 
% If instead, you include actual maps or plates in the thesis (often printed on paper that is different from that used for the text), then they must be folded to 7 by 10 inches to fit the thesis pocket. Examples of more complicated folding of large graphics may be found in bound theses that are stored in the Arthur Lakes Library. Each plate must have a title, plate number, and author's name placed on the outside fold. Plates are a type of figure listed separately in the front matter, as are equations and tables.
% 
% \subsection{Including Equations}
% 
% Equations appear either as part of running text in a paragraph, or are set apart from the text (displayed), depending on their length. In either case, punctuation must be used appropriately. Equations must be typeset; handwritten characters are not acceptable.
% 
% \subsubsection{Placing equations}
% 
% Equations may occur in running text, but all numbered equations must be displayed, that is, placed on separate lines and either centered or indented a consistent distance from the left text margin.
% 
% \subsubsection{Numbering equations}
% 
%% All equations \emph{referred to} in the text must be numbered, although not all displayed equations must be numbered. As in numbering figures and tables, a double numbering system is used for equations; for example, Equation 2.1, where 2 is the chapter, and 1 is the first numbered equation in that chapter,
%\iffalse
\renewcommand{\theequation}{\@arabic\c@section.\@arabic\c@equation}

%\fi
% \begin{equation}
% \renewcommand{\theequation}{2.1}
% 	\Gamma - \delta \times a = 0\textrm{.}
% \end{equation}
% 
% The equation number is placed flush with the right text margin and enclosed in parentheses. Equations in running text are not numbered.
% 
% \subsubsection{Breaking equations}
% 
% An equation too long for one line is broken before an operational sign. Unless the equation is centered, the second line can be flush right, aligned on an operational sign, or indented far enough from the right to make room for the equation number. Equations longer than two lines are aligned on operational or descriptive signs.
% 
% If a repeated part of the formula is replaced with an ellipsis (three spaced periods [. . .]), all appropriate punctuation and operational signs (for example, a final comma or sign in a series) are still included. Thus, the writer uses the following format:
% \begin{eqnarray*}
% 	& & P1, P2, \cdots , Pn \\
% 	& & P1 + P2 + \cdots + Pn \\
% 	& & P = 1, 2, \cdots
% \end{eqnarray*}
% \textbf{not}
% \begin{eqnarray*}
% 	& & P1, P2, \cdots Pn \\
% 	& & P1 + P2 + \cdots Pn \\
% 	& & P = 1, 2 \cdots
% \end{eqnarray*}
% 
% \subsection{Referencing Sources in Text}
% \label{sec:referencing-sources}
% 
% There are various methods to reference sources in running text. Two popular methods are described below: 1) the numerical system, and 2) the author-date system (also known as the USGS system).
% 
% \note{Your thesis advisor must approve your choice of documentation system.}
% 
% \subsubsection{Numerical system}
% 
% In the numerical reference system, an information source is cited by placing a number in parentheses on the text line at the appropriate place in the text. The number corresponds to the entry with the same number in the back matter REFERENCES CITED list. In this system, references are ordered numerically throughout the thesis, from its beginning to end. If more than one reference is cited at the same point in the text, the reference numbers in parentheses are arranged in ascending order. These reference numbers may also be placed as superscripts. Here are two examples:
% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item {\ldots} likely to occur in natural hydrothermal systems~(1).
% 	\item {\ldots} is the subject of numerous solubility studies$^{(1, 5, 7)}$.
% \end{itemize}
% 
% \subsubsection{Author-date system}
% 
% In the author-date system, the simplest source reference gives the author's last name and the source publication year enclosed in parentheses at the appropriate place in the thesis text. There may be slight differences in punctuation, so the author must choose a pattern from a good handbook, such as the latest edition of the \emph{Chicago Manual of Style}, and apply the pattern consistently throughout the thesis.
% 
% Source references are placed just before a mark of punctuation or at a logical place in the sentence being documented. If some or all of the source citation is incorporated into the text, the parentheses are not necessary.
% 
% \begin{quote}
% 	Smith and Jones (1991) reported\ldots\newline
% 	or\newline
% 	In Smith and Jones 1990a, the case\ldots
% \end{quote}

% \subsection{Using Footnotes}
% 
% Footnotes are used only to include extra, peripheral information that amplifies the text and might interest the reader, but that is not essential to the text. Footnotes may define acronyms or other terms, give copyright or trademark information, or provide supplementary information, \emph{but they are not used} to document sources of text information.
% 
% Footnotes are indicated by a superscript number at the appropriate place in the text, \emph{outside any punctuation}. Note that this differs from source reference numbers, which are placed inside punctuation. Footnotes are numbered consecutively throughout the thesis, and most word processing programs will automatically number and format footnotes on the page.
% 
%\iffalse
%% Force footnotes to always appear at the very bottom of the page
\RequirePackage[hang,flushmargin,bottom]{footmisc}

%\fi
% \subsection{Using Copyrighted Material}
% \label{sec:using-copyrighted-material}
% 
% If you use copyrighted material in a limited way, permission to quote is not necessary. However, if you use extensive material from a copyrighted work, you must obtain the owner's permission in writing. The publisher usually has the authority to grant permission to quote excerpts from the copyrighted work or can refer requests to the copyright owner or designated representative. The copyright owner may charge a fee for permission to quote. Permissions should be credited in the Acknowledgments, and the source should appear in the References Cited. Include the written release to use copyrighted material in an appendix to the thesis.
% 
% In many fields, it is common for candidates to publish their research results prior to completion of the degree and to include material from these prior publications, in whole or in part, in the thesis. To the extent that this practice encourages student participation in the wider research enterprise and a wider dissemination of student research results, we encourage departments to adopt this model.
% 
% \textit{\textbf{Permission to include previously published material.}} The shelving of a thesis or dissertation in the Library and access to dissertations through UMI (ProQuest) Dissertation Publishing is a form of publication. Most journal and book publishers require authors to sign over copyright to articles or book chapters to the publisher. Publishers' copyright policies may, or may not, allow re-publication of these articles as part of a candidate's thesis or dissertation. Additionally, re-publication of journal articles as part of a thesis or dissertation is not explicitly covered under section 107 of the copyright act; the socalled ``fair use'' section.
% 
% \important{Thus, in the case where copyright of articles or book chapters included in a thesis or dissertation has been turned over to an external publisher, \emph{it is the responsibility of the candidate to obtain permission from the publisher to include these materials in a thesis or dissertation}. Copies of this permission should be included as an appendix to the thesis or dissertation.}
% 
% To obtain permission, candidates should initially look at the publisher's website. Some publishers (e.g., The American Chemical Society and Elsevier) provide a document or policy statement on their website that explicitly allows materials produced by the candidate to be included in their thesis or dissertation without obtaining explicit permission. Others (e.g., IEEE, SEG and ASME) provide links and directions as to how to obtain the necessary permission from the publisher.
% 
% In these latter cases, please be aware, that despite a candidate's best efforts, publishers are not obligated to respond to requests for permission to re-publish. If a candidate has attempted to contact a publisher but has received no response, existing Copyright Law requires that this non-response be interpreted as a denial of permission to re-publish.
% 
% \textit{\textbf{Permission to include multi-authored papers.}} In addition to the above permissions, in some disciplines, it is normal to consider the inclusion of materials that are multi-authored in a thesis or dissertation. This is particularly true when collaboration and co-operation are required for researchers to undertake basic research efforts at the frontiers of their disciplines, either because of the nature of the work or the nature of the facilities involved. For materials included in a thesis or dissertation, however, it is presumed that the candidate is the primary owner of the intellectual activities described.
% 
% If co-authored material is to be included in a candidate's thesis or dissertation, the Thesis Committee and the Department Head/Division Director of the candidate's home department/division must approve of the appropriateness of the inclusion of this material in the thesis or dissertation. Additionally, if the material was co-authored by authors other than the candidate's advisor or thesis committee members, the candidate must obtain permission from each co-author to reproduce the material as part of the thesis or dissertation. Copies of this permission should be included as an appendix to the thesis or dissertation.
% 
% It is the practice of the CSM library to provide copies of theses/dissertations to library patrons upon request for a reproduction fee. As such, the Library asks students to provide them permission to disseminate theses/dissertations through this means.
% 
% \note{It is unlikely the standard permission to include copyrighted material in a thesis or dissertation that you receive from a professional society will also include permission for the Library to reproduce and distribute your thesis/dissertation. Unless specific approval is received from the external copyright holder, for library reproduction and dissemination, the Library can not provide copies of your thesis/dissertation to its patrons when it includes significant sections of externally copyrighted material.}
% 
% \section{About the Back Matter}
% 
% Back matter is the documenting and reference material that follows the main body of a thesis, and other information that supplements the main thesis text.
% 
% \subsection{Page Sequence}
% 
% The back matter of the thesis may include the following:
% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item Glossary\dotfill (optional)
% 	\item List of abbreviations\dotfill (optional)
% 	\item References cited\dotfill (required)
% 	\item Selected bibliography\dotfill (optional)
% 	\item Appendix or appendices\dotfill (optional)
% \end{itemize}
% 
% A glossary of terms and a list of \index{abbreviations} are optional in a thesis and may be placed either right before the list of references cited or immediately following the last list of illustrations in the front matter.
% 
% It is probable that a thesis would not need a Selected Bibliography section (sometimes called additional readings) because all sources of information for the discussion are included in the References Cited. A thesis is not required to have appendices; however, if you want to include supplementary information that is too long to place in a footnote, then appendices are appropriate.
% 
% \subsection{Titles and Headings}
% 
% The title for each part of the back matter is typed in all capital letters (for example, REFERENCES CITED or APPENDIX).
% 
% For references and bibliographies, the title is centered between the left and right text margins, one keyboard return below the one-inch top page margin. Appropriate space is left between the title and the line of text below. For appendices, the heading APPENDIX may either be placed at the top of the page as for the reference headings, or it may be centered on a separate page preceding the appendix. If there is more than one appendix, they are identified with capital letters APPENDIX A, APPENDIX B, etc.
% 
% \subsection{References Cited}
% 
% The References Cited list is the only back matter that is required in each thesis. The list includes only sources that are cited in the thesis front matter, main body, or back matter (appendices). Other related material on the thesis topic that may be of interest to the reader may be listed in a Selected Bibliography.
% 
% \subsubsection{Order of references}
% 
% The order of the items listed in the References Cited depends upon the citation system you choose to use in the thesis text. See the previous section (Referencing Sources in Text) for descriptions of the numerical and author-date reference systems.
% 
% In the numerical reference system, sources are ordered numerically as they appear from thesis beginning to end, and the sequence of the items in the references cited list in the thesis corresponds to those numbers in the text. In the author-date system, the list of sources is alphabetized by author's last name.
% 
% \subsubsection{Format of references}
% 
% The format for reference entries may be chosen by the writer, but must have the approval of the writer's department and thesis committee. You must keep the format consistent throughout the list.
% 
% The two common list entry styles{--}a traditional and a modern{--}differ mostly in the use of capitalization, punctuation marks, and abbreviations. The OGS recommends the simpler modern format, which the most recent edition of the \emph{Chicago Manual of Style} identifies as appropriate for a scientific bibliography.
% 
% \emph{The Chicago Manual of Style} has useful examples of entries for books, articles, public documents, anonymous or unpublished works, book series, and several works by the same author. Other examples of reference formats are found in the \emph{American Chemical Society Style Guide} (especially for patents, reports, abstracts, oral presentations, and unpublished material) and in the style guides of journals in the thesis writer's field.
% 
% \subsection{Selected Bibliography}
% 
% The Selected Bibliography may also be called additional readings. It lists sources of information that are related to the thesis topic and that might interest a reader who wants to pursue the topic. Selected bibliographies are optional and not typically included in a scientific thesis. The format and content of entries must be the same in both the References Cited and for the Selected Bibliography lists.
% 
% \subsection{Appendices}\index{appendices!contents}
% 
% Appendix material is information that is not essential to the text but that contributes to it. Appendices are used to include information such as the following:
% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item Original data
% 	\item Long quotations
% 	\item Supporting legal decisions or laws
% 	\item Computer codes and programs
% 	\item Lithologic and petrographic descriptions
% 	\item Questionnaires
% 	\item Forms and documents
% 	\item Permissions to use copyrighted material
% 	\item Long tables
% \end{itemize}
%

%\fi
% 
% \index{appendices!on CDs or DVDs}
% You may include long appendices on CDs or DVDs, instead of including them in the printed thesis copies. These disks, in jewel cases, will be inserted in the thesis pocket during the binding process. In either instance, appendices are listed in the table of contents.
% 
% \subsubsection{Numbering in appendices}\index{appendices!numbering in}
% 
% Figure, table and equation numbers in appendices are preceded with the appropriate appendix letter, e.g., the first equation appearing in Appendix A, would be numbered (A-1).
% 
% \subsection{Thesis Pocket Contents}
% \label{sec:thesis-pocket-contents}
% 
% If a thesis includes plates, maps, CDs/DVDs, or other material that is not bound into the text, heavy-paper box pockets constructed to hold the material are attached to the inside of the back cover when the thesis is bound.
% 
% \subsubsection{Special types of pages}
% 
% Plates and maps larger than the thesis page margins are folded to 7 by 10 inches to fit into the thesis cover pocket.
% 
% \subsubsection{Labeling pocket contents}
% 
% Each plate or map must have a title, plate number and the author's name on the outside fold. Computer disks are labeled as described below.
% 
% \subsubsection{Electronic material}
% 
% Original computer programs or data files that are part of a thesis may be included on a CD or DVD. Operating system formats may be Windows, Mac, or UNIX, but the operating system must be cited on the label. See page~\pageref{sec:computer-disks} of this guide for labeling instructions and \ref{apx:examples} for a label example.
% 
% \section{Printing Your Thesis}
% \label{sec:printing-thesis}
% 
% After your thesis has been approved by the OGS, you are responsible for the printing of the required copies of the thesis that are submitted to the Arthur Lakes Library for binding and preservation.
% 
% \subsection{Volume thickness}
% 
% \important{Because of binding limitations, the thickness of the thesis must not total more than two inches. This limit includes thesis pages and foldout pages, maps, plates, and computer disks together (see \hyperref[sec:multi-volume-thesis]{Multi-volume thesis}, page~\pageref{sec:multi-volume-thesis}).}
% 
% \subsection{Number of copies}
% 
% You will deliver six copies of your thesis (seven copies, if there is a co-advisor) to Arthur Lakes Library Preservation Unit.
% 
% \begin{table}
% 	\caption{\label{tab:copies}Distribution of Thesis Copies}
% 	\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{|l|X|X|}
% 		 \hline
% 		  & \textbf{Owner/Use} & \textbf{Format} \\
% 		 \hline
% 		 Copy 1 & Library/Vault & Bound \\
% 		 \hline
% 		 Copy 2 & Library/Circulation & Bound \\
% 		 \hline
% 		 Copy 3 & Department & Bound or CD \\
% 		 \hline
% 		 Copy 4 & Student & Bound or CD \\
% 		 \hline
% 		 Copy 5 & Advisor & Bound or CD \\
% 		 \hline
% 		 Copy 6 & Library/Microfiche & Unbound \\
% 		 \hline
% 		 Copy 7 & Co-advisor & Bound or CD \\
% 		 \hline
% 	\end{tabularx}
% \end{table}
% \note{If you need seven bound copies, there is an additional fee paid, in addition to the graduation fee. Along with the hard copies of the thesis, you are advised to submit a back up of the entire thesis on a properly labeled CD/DVD. The copies are distributed as shown in \ref{tab:copies}.}
% 
% \subsection{Print quality}
% 
% The printing of all final thesis copies must be ``letter quality.'' Make certain that the type and graphics reproduce clearly, sharply, and with uniform blackness. Laser printing and superior quality inkjet printing are both acceptable methods.
% 
% \subsection{Printing one sided and two sided}
% 
% \important{You are encouraged to submit two-sided copies of the thesis. However, remember that although pages in the body and back matter of the thesis may be printed two sided, each page of the front matter and every new chapter must begin on a ``new,'' i.e., right-hand page.}
% 
% \subsection{Required paper}
% 
% \important{Required copies of the thesis or dissertation must be printed on acidfree bond paper. Acid-free paper is widely used in books and other important documents intended to last for at least 100 years. Paper that is not acid free quickly yellows and deteriorates and is therefore not acceptable for the Library's preservation purposes.}
% 
% In addition to acid-free paper, copies that are printed two-sided must be of 24-weight bond paper. For those printed single sided, 20-weight bond paper is acceptable.
% 
% Kinko's and CSM Copy Center (Guggenheim Hall) or other facilities can reproduce your thesis onto acid-free paper. Acid-free paper is also available from the CSM Bookstore for those students who wish to print using their own printer.
% 
% CSM Copy Center can also copy your thesis onto ``CSM watermark paper,'' a type of acid-free paper with the CSM logo embedded. Use of CSM watermark paper is not required, though many students prefer it.
% 
% \subsection{Proofing copies}
% 
% You are responsible for checking each printed copy of the thesis to ensure that there are no missing pages and that all pages are in order. Crossing out of letters or words, strikeovers, liquid-paper corrections, or erasures are not acceptable on final copies.
% 
% \subsection{Copying your thesis onto CD/DVD}
% 
% With permission of your advisor and department, you may submit three (or four) of your required thesis copies on separate CD/DVDs: one each for the department, the advisor(s), and the student. The other three copies printed on paper are submitted to the Library.
% 
% \note{Although you submit copies of your thesis on CD/DVD, there is no downward adjustment of the graduation fee.}
% 
% When the copies are delivered to the library for preservation, they must have all graphics and special materials (plates, figures, foldouts, maps, computer disks, etc.) folded, labeled, and placed in the same order as they are listed in the table of contents, just as is required when you submit your thesis to OGS for the final format approval.
% 
% \subsection{Photographs}
% 
% Actual photographs are not acceptable in the thesis. You must scan photographs to digital format or make copies of pages with original photographs. Color photographs must be color printed.
% 
% \subsection{Computer disks}
% \label{sec:computer-disks}
% 
% To reduce the size of the thesis, you are encouraged to put long appendices, plates, maps, and other oversized pages on CD/DVD, rather than as physical additions to the thesis. Additionally, original program or data files may be submitted on ``readonly'' CD/DVD.
% 
% \important{The CD/DVD's must be submitted in a plastic jewel case at the same time the paper text of the thesis is submitted. The CD/DVD must have computer-printed (not handwritten) labels that contain the title of the thesis, the author's name, ``Colorado School of Mines,'' names and versions of all software used to create the files, and the contents of the disk. See the disk label example in \ref{apx:examples}.}
% 
% \paragraph{CD/DVD Virus-Scan Certification.}
% 
% Required beginning Fall 2008, all CD/DVDs submitted with final thesis copies to the Arthur Lakes Library must first be scanned for viruses and other malicious software by IT personnel in the Academic and Computing and Networking department (AC\&N). Disks proven to contain no problems will receive a signature of certification. Do not submit your CD/DVD for scanning until after your thesis receives final format approval by OGS.
% 
% \subsection{Plates}
% 
% Plates larger than the margins are folded to 7 by 10 inches and submitted with the thesis. All plates must be labeled on the outside fold with the plate title, plate number, author's name, and thesis title.
% 
% Oversized foldout pages With OGS approval, you may include foldout pages. The pages must be folded so that 1{\textonehalf} inches remain at the left (binding) side. The right-hand fold should be {\textonequarter} inch from the right edge of the text page and should be an engineer fold. OGS staff is able to advise you in this matter and examples are available in theses stored in Arthur Lakes Library.
% 
% \section{Submitting Your Thesis to Arthur Lakes Library}
% \label{sec:submitting-your-thesis}
% 
% In order that the Library might protect and preserve Colorado School of Mines graduate theses and dissertations, each graduate student in a thesis program must submit required copies of their thesis to the Library Preservation Unit prior to the thesis deadline set by the OGS.
% 
% \subsection{Where to submit}
% 
% Submit your thesis or dissertation to Margaret Katz, Collections Conservator, Preservation Unit, Room 170. The Preservation Unit is open Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. and 12 noon to 4:00 p.m.
% 
% \emph{Directions to the Preservation Unit:} When you enter the library lobby, turn right toward the Reference Room. Turn left just before the Reference Room and go down the long east-west hallway until you reach the elevator. Take the elevator down to Level 1. Turn left as you exit the elevator. The Preservation Unit is immediately to the left of the elevator behind double doors.
% 
% \subsection{What to submit}
% 
% Arthur Lakes Library will accept from graduating students ONLY the six copies (or seven copies, if there is an officially designated co-advisor) that are required by the OGS. Binding of additional copies is the responsibility of the student or the department.
% 
% \subsection{Library thesis binding policy}
% 
% Certain library materials, such as graduate theses and journals, are bound according to special guidelines for academic libraries in order to ensure that the resulting book has longevity of at least 100 years. These materials are sent to a binding company that specializes in creating books to meet this archival standard. An average turnaround time is four months.
% 
% The binding will be done to the Library's specifications; custom binding is not possible.
% 
% Students or departments wishing to customize the binding of their thesis (i.e., style, color, cover and spine stamping) or desiring faster turnaround, should deal directly with a commercial binding vendor. If you wish to pursue custom binding, you must notify the Library in advance, and then submit to the Library only the three copies that ultimately reside there.
% 
% Following are suggested local binderies:
% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item Denver Bookbinding (hardcover archival binding).\newline Website: \url{http://www.denverbook.com/}.
% 	\item Kinko's Copies (soft cover bindings) at various metro-area locations
% 	\item CSM Copy Center (soft cover bindings), {\first} Floor, Guggenheim Hall.
% \end{itemize}
% 
% \subsection{Submission checklist}
% 
% Before submitting your thesis or dissertation to the Library Preservation Unit, please take the following steps:
% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item Proofread your title page
% 	\item Obtain submittal sheet signatures and dates from your advisor(s) and department head.
% 	\item Receive final format approval from the OGS.
% 	\item Make the required six copies on acidfree paper. Only those students who have an officially-designated co-advisor may submit seven copies for binding.
% 	\item Check all thesis copies, making certain all pages are included and in proper order.
% 	\item Obtain the required virus scan certification from\newline AC\&N for all CD/DVDs included with the thesis.\newline (See \hyperref[sec:computer-disks]{Computer disks}, p. \pageref{sec:computer-disks}.).
% 	\item Include accompanying material (maps, CDs, etc.), if applicable.
% 	\item Fold any maps and inserts.
% 	\item Pay all applicable graduation fees to the CSM cashier.
% 	\item Take the Graduate School's blue checkout card with you.
% \end{itemize}
% 
% \subsection{Distributing the bound thesis}
% 
% After the thesis has been bound and delivered to the Library, the copies for the department, advisor(s), and student are forwarded to the department. Contact your department office for information about its distribution policies
